Class component that fetches data from the server you now have running - the data can be fetched from http://localhost:5000/api/players
    - change default app to Class
    - use componentDidMount for axios call

Display the player data you receive from the API
    - return harvested players data 

 Build a custom hook and use it in your app
    - try dark mode first

Write a "reasonable" amount of unit tests
