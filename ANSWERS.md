- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

For state management. Class components are used for state management, and to handle component lifecyle events.
Function components don't handle the application state.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

render renders the component to the UI
componentDidMount allows the use of state
componentDidUpdate updates the DOM

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks help keep code DRY by letting us re-use stateful logic.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing brings up bugs quicker, acts as code documentation, and make us learn to write better code.
